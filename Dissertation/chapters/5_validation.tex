\chapter{System Validation}

\section{Testing}
% What testing was performed, why it was selected, what are the key use cases
% Unit tests on the storage API
% Regression testing, how it worked with iterations etc
% Integration testing
	\subsection{Unit Testing}
	% Storage server, why only storage? Suitability

	% Screenshots of unit tests passing - appendix?

	\subsection{White Box Testing}
	% Testing the system with knowledge of the internal workings
	\subsection{Black Box Testing}
	% Testing the system from the perspective of a user without any knowledge of the inner workings of the system

	\subsection{Regression Testing}
	% Testing areas that may have been changed from a patch/iteration/etc

	\subsection{Integration Testing}
	% Testing how the web server and storage server communicate, etc. When they were brought together, testing each route etc.

	\subsection{Performance}
	% Compare ram usage to facebook
	\paragraph{Page loading speed}
	% PageSpeed test - Google Developers
	% figure: compression.png
	% https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights
	% https://flask-compress.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
	\paragraph{Frames per second}
	% Chrome's built-in FPS counter (about:flags)
	% 60fps.png
	% Comparison of performance to other game engines?

	\subsection{Compatibility}
	% Tested games on android tablet, laptop, desktop, chrome, firefox
	% Screenshot on android?

\section{Evaluation}
	\subsection{Usability}
		% Neilsen's heuristics etc
	\subsection{User Testing}
		% Users didn't realise that saving was automatic
		% Feedback etc

\section{Demonstration}
% Identify what features can be demonstrated and show screenshots or reference a video online to show the project demonstration
