\chapter{Architecture \& Development}
\section{System Architecture}
% Overview of sys arch, diagram to rep the key elements
%	 Architectural patterns used
	\subsection{Environment}
	% Local system, Python, Pip, Virtualbox, libraries needed
	% Downloading the JS libs (Bootstrap, Handlebars, Three, Ammo, Ace, etc)
	% Sublime, GitHub, EB CLI

% MongoDB?

\section{System Components}
% Details of each component, problems encountered and resolved, challenges overcome or worked around
% 
	\subsection{Scalable Cloud Deployment}
	% - Setting up AWS
	% - Storage server {MongoDB, git, cloning the storage repo}
	% - Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk {eb cli}
	\subsection{Web Server}
	% - Load balancing
	% - Communication with storage server, GitHub API
	% - Connecting to MongoDB on storage server
	\subsection{Storage Server}
	% - Why this was it's own server
	% - Deployment was an issue compared to Elastic Beanstalk
	\subsection{Game Engine}
	% - Using Three.js
	% - Using Ammo.js
	% - Simplifying the two libraries into the ECS architecture
	% 	This was achieved by etc.
	\subsection{Game Editor}
	% - Tying in the game engine with the storage backend
	% - Properties of both the gamedata json and the displayed game entities
	% - Pseudo MVC microframework

\section{Key Development Components}
% Identify key development components
% Key components were the game engine, editor, web server (load balancing) and storage.
% Git integration wasn't as important to functionality

\section{External APIs}
% Indentification/explanation of external APIs used vs own code. 

\section{List of Classes}
% List of classes of your code
% Write block comments for code during this process?
